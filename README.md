# Clicker game

On scratch, [clicker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4v1CIKehF6E) games are all the [rage](https://scratch.mit.edu/search/projects?q=clicker). So I thought I would make on in Go, with [bubbletea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea)!

```
$ go install github.com/spraints/clicker-bubbletea@latest
$ clicker-bubbletea
```

See how quickly you can win!
